# UniCycle
Public good on-chain global learning certification (ETH Global Istanbul 2023 Submission).
For both teaching methods:
- by university credits issued tokens
- by schools claiming an NFT for students evaluated succesfully
  
## Credit Transfer in Education

## Summary

UniCycle is a  transferring credits to students from Universities as well as non acredited schools. In the case of universities, credits are converted into tokens and securely transferred using public key encryption and hashing. Upon course completion, credits are converted into tokens and stored in the blockchain wallet.

## 2. State of the art academic literature

The project aligns with ongoing initiatives in applying blockchain to education. Earlier models tackled challenges like preventing certificate forgery, facilitating credit transfers, and enhancing data security. Blockchain-based systems bring forth advantages such as transparency, efficiency, and security in the storage and validation of academic credentials.

## Implementation

The Ethereum smart contract is programmed in Solidity, presenting an ecosystem for higher educational organizations. Tokens, ownership transfers, and secure math functions ensure the integrity and security of the system.

#### Replay Attack

The system resists replay attacks, where attackers seize and replay messages to disguise their identity.

#### Collusion Tamper Attack

The proposed scheme updates data periodically to public Ethereum, reducing the likelihood of collusion tamper attacks.

## 6. Conclusion

The ecosystem for credit transfer and a evaluation certification in education provides in a long term a secure, transparent, and efficient solution. Through smart contracts and decentralized storage, we ensure the integrity of academic credentials and facilitate seamless credit transfers. The system's resilience to various attacks and scalability make it a robust solution for the future of education. Enabling a student to demostrate his academic learning skills even not having went to higher education institutions.
